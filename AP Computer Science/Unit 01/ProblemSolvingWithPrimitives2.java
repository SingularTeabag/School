                       For example, if 'dayOfWeek1 = 0'(January 1st is a Sunday) and 'day = 13'.
                       (January 13th), then 'dayOfWeek', the day of the week for January 13th,

                       parameters, current hours and minutes (before 1 p.m.). and return (not print!)
                       the number of minutes left until lunch, scheduled for 1 p.m. Add a 'main'
                       method that prompts the user for the current time (in the format hh:mm),
                       calls'minutesUntilLaunch', and prints the value returned by the call. Make
                       sure your program displays the correct result when the user enters 9:00,
                       10:10, 12:00, 12:50.*/
